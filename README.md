This repository contains the Power BI dashboard project designed to analyze and visualize grocery sales data for Blinkit. The project leverages detailed sales data to extract insights on sales trends, customer preferences, and operational efficiencies. This interactive dashboard is built using Power BI and is aimed at providing Blinkit with actionable business intelligence to enhance decision-making processes.

### Project Overview

### Objectives
-Data Visualization: To create a comprehensive visualization of the sales data to highlight key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, average sales per transaction, and customer satisfaction ratings.
- Interactive Analysis: To implement dynamic filtering capabilities that allow end-users to explore data across various dimensions such as item type, outlet size, and fat content.
- Sales Trend Identification: To identify and analyze trends in sales data by outlet location, item category, and customer preferences.

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Power BI: Used for all data modeling, transformation, and visualization tasks.
- Data Transformation Features in Power BI: Applied to clean and optimize the dataset for analysis.

### Data Preparation
- The dataset included 8,523 records spread across 12 columns, detailing transactions from Blinkit's operations. The data was subjected to a rigorous cleaning process to fix discrepancies and transform it into a usable format for analysis.

### Dashboard Features
- KPI Visualizations: Total sales of $1.2 million and average sales per transaction of $141.
- Customer Ratings: Visualized average customer ratings with an insight into areas for improvement.
- Sales Distribution: Analyzed by item type, outlet size, and fat content through interactive donut charts and bar graphs.
- Dynamic Filters: Allow users to customize views based on outlet location, item type, and other metrics.

### Key Insights
- Outlet Performance: Tier 3 outlets, typically in less urbanized areas, show higher sales volumes compared to Tier 1 and 2.
- Product Preferences: Low-fat products account for a higher percentage of sales, indicating a consumer trend towards healthier options.
- Customer Satisfaction: High ratings for household items and fresh produce suggest satisfaction with these products, whereas lower ratings for snacks and beverages highlight areas for improvement.
